If you are using Codepen, use the following links to change the avatar from the default blue avatar:

* Pink Avatar: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/929057/avatar-pink.svg
* Purple Avatar: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/929057/avatar-purple.svg
* Green Avatar: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/929057/avatar-green.svg
* Blue Avatar: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/929057/avatar-blue.svg

<img src="readme-files/techlady avatar gifs.gif?raw=true" width="600">

If you are on a local machine: 
You may use the links above or utilize the avatar images that are located in the images folder. In the HTML file on line 29 change the color in the name of the svg image and you're done!

### Background

![Examples of background images](readme-files/backgrounds.png?raw=true "Background image examples")

If you are using Codepen, use the following links to change the background-image (shapes) for the body. Then change the background-color to customize further:

* Light Shapes Background: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/929057/geometry-white.svg
* Dark Shapes Background: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/929057/geometry-black.svg

If you are on a local machine: 
You may use the links above or utilize the background images that are located in the images folder. In the CSS file on line 20, change out the link with images/geometry-black.svg (or white).

Bonus Purple Shapes Background (default): https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/929057/geometry-purple.svg

### Suggested Challenges & Updates
Now that you have built the game, let's try some extra features! Below is a list of suggested challenges and features you could add to this game to learn more about JavaScript and jQuery.

* Optimize the code. In the final version of the game there are functions that can be condensed, try it out!
* Add a starting screen with instructions and a game start button.
* Allow the user to choose their own avatar before the game starts. (You have four avatar images provided for you!)
* Add additional user statistics.
* Add animations such as changing the background color of a button when clicked or slide transitions.
* Convert the jQuery code to vanilla JavaScript.
* Animate the avatar SVG image so that the avatar smiles when a statistic increases and frowns when it decreases.
